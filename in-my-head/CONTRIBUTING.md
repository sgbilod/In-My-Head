## üìù Style Guidelines

### Code Style

**TypeScript/JavaScript**:

```typescript
// Good: Clear, typed, documented
/**
 * Process a document and extract metadata.
 * @param filePath - Path to the document
 * @returns Processed document with metadata
 */
async function processDocument(filePath: string): Promise<Document> {
  const content = await readFile(filePath);
  return {
    id: generateId(),
    content,
    metadata: extractMetadata(content),
  };
}

// Bad: Untyped, unclear
async function process(f: any) {
  const c = await readFile(f);
  return { id: gen(), c, m: meta(c) };
}
```

**Python**:

```python
# Good: Typed, documented, clear
def process_document(file_path: str) -> Document:
    """
    Process a document and extract metadata.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the document

    Returns:
        Processed document with metadata

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    return Document(
        id=generate_id(),
        content=content,
        metadata=extract_metadata(content)
    )

# Bad: No types, unclear
def process(f):
    c = open(f).read()
    return {'id': gen(), 'c': c, 'm': meta(c)}
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams for complex concepts
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Use proper Markdown formatting

### Commit Message Style

```
# Good
feat(search): add vector search with Qdrant integration

- Implement semantic search using embeddings
- Add query optimization for large document sets
- Include caching for frequent queries

Closes #123

# Bad
added search stuff
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

```typescript
// TypeScript example with Jest
describe('DocumentProcessor', () => {
  let processor: DocumentProcessor;

  beforeEach(() => {
    processor = new DocumentProcessor();
  });

  it('should process PDF documents', async () => {
    const result = await processor.process('test.pdf');

    expect(result.type).toBe('pdf');
    expect(result.content).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.metadata).toHaveProperty('pageCount');
  });

  it('should handle missing files gracefully', async () => {
    await expect(processor.process('missing.pdf')).rejects.toThrow('File not found');
  });
});
```

```python
# Python example with pytest
class TestDocumentProcessor:
    @pytest.fixture
    def processor(self):
        return DocumentProcessor()

    def test_process_pdf(self, processor):
        result = processor.process('test.pdf')

        assert result.type == 'pdf'
        assert result.content is not None
        assert 'page_count' in result.metadata

    def test_missing_file(self, processor):
        with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
            processor.process('missing.pdf')
```

### Integration Tests

Test service interactions:

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_document_search_pipeline():
    # Index document
    doc_id = await document_processor.index('test.pdf')

    # Wait for indexing
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    # Search for content
    results = await search_service.search('test query')

    assert len(results) > 0
    assert any(r.document_id == doc_id for r in results)
```

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### README Updates

- Keep README concise but comprehensive
- Update feature lists when adding features
- Update installation steps if changed
- Add screenshots for UI changes

### Code Comments

```typescript
// Good: Explains WHY, not WHAT
// Cache results for 5 minutes to reduce API calls and improve response time
const cacheResult = await cache.set(key, result, 300);

// Bad: States the obvious
// Set the cache
const cacheResult = await cache.set(key, result, 300);
```

### API Documentation

Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs:

```typescript
/**
 * @openapi
 * /api/documents:
 *   post:
 *     summary: Upload and process a document
 *     requestBody:
 *       required: true
 *       content:
 *         multipart/form-data:
 *           schema:
 *             type: object
 *             properties:
 *               file:
 *                 type: string
 *                 format: binary
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: Document processed successfully
 *       400:
 *         description: Invalid file format
 */
```

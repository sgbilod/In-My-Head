## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### Priority 1: Complete Frontend Foundation (Stream A)

**Goal:** Get basic app structure running  
**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Tasks:**

1. Create Auth Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
2. Create App Layout (`src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`)
3. Create Sidebar Navigation (`src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)
4. Update routing in `src/App.tsx`
5. Add React Query setup in `src/main.tsx`
6. Test API client with real endpoints

**Success Criteria:**

- App loads without errors
- Can make API calls
- Layout renders correctly
- Navigation works

---

### Priority 2: Build Collections Backend (Stream B)

**Goal:** Enable multi-document organization  
**Time:** 3-4 hours

**Tasks:**

1. Create migration file for collections table
2. Add collection_id column to documents table
3. Create `src/services/collection_service.py`
4. Update `rag_service.py` with collection filtering
5. Create `src/routes/collections.py`
6. Write unit tests

**Success Criteria:**

- Can create collections
- Can add documents to collections
- RAG searches respect collection scope
- All tests pass

---

### Priority 3: Optimize Docker Images (Stream C)

**Goal:** Production-ready containers  
**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Tasks:**

1. Create `services/ai-engine/Dockerfile` (multi-stage)
2. Create `services/document-processor/Dockerfile`
3. Update `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`
4. Add health checks to all services
5. Test image builds
6. Measure image sizes

**Success Criteria:**

- Images < 500MB each
- Build time < 5 minutes
- All health checks pass

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Parallel Execution:

1. **Stream A (Frontend)** - Can work independently

   - No backend changes needed
   - Uses existing APIs
   - Good for frontend developers

2. **Stream B (Collections)** - Can work independently

   - Backend-only changes
   - No frontend impact yet
   - Good for backend developers

3. **Stream C (Docker)** - Can work independently
   - Infrastructure changes
   - No code changes needed
   - Good for DevOps engineers

### Coordination Points:

- **Week 2:** Frontend will need Collections API (Stream B)
- **Week 2:** CI/CD (Stream C) will need optimized Dockerfiles
- **Week 3:** Monitoring (Stream C) connects to all services

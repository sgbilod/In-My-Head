## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**:

   - Use `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
   - Use environment variables
   - Use secure vaults for API keys

2. **Keep dependencies updated**:

   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   pip-audit --fix
   ```

3. **Run security scans**:

   ```bash
   npm audit
   docker scan <image>
   ```

4. **Use strong authentication**:
   - Enable 2FA on all accounts
   - Use SSH keys for Git operations
   - Rotate API keys regularly

### For End Users

1. **Keep the application updated**:

   - Install updates promptly
   - Enable automatic updates if available

2. **Protect your data**:

   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable encryption features
   - Regular backups

3. **Be cautious with plugins**:

   - Only install plugins from trusted sources
   - Review permissions before installation
